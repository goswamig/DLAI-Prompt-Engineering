Two key principles 
1. Clear and specific instruction
2. Give model time to think 

1.1 Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input. 
1.2 Ask for structured output
1.3 Check whether condictions are satisfied 
1.4 Few shot prompting: Give successful examples of completing tasks then ask model to perform the task

2.1 Specify the steps reqiored to complete a task
2.2 Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion


Model limitations:
Hallucinations: Makes a statement which is not true.
Reduce hallucinations : First find relevant information then answer the question based on the relevant information.
